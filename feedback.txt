Improvements:
- Originially thought this was a handheld, hand pressed pad. Was surprised to see the max weight of 150 at the bottom. Clarify this earlier. (also 150 is very light I'm 200 bro)
- Prototype plan doesnt explicitly say whether the design is evolutionary or experimental


Good things:
- Good technical summary under software breakdown
- Good summary of hardware use(d)
- good description of project
